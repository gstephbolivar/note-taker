## Usage

This [heroku deployed application](https://floating-plains-97674.herokuapp.com/) allows a user to write, save and delete notes. If a user needs to create a note this application will allow them to title their note and then write in the text area. Once the note is saved, it renders to a list by title on the left hand side of the screen, allowing for easy access to notes. 

## Contributing

A user can contribute by styling the webpage differently.
